    <p className="hero--header">Hi there, I&apos;m Ratnasmabhav Priyadarshi</p>
    <p className="hero--text">I&apos;m studying Computer Science at VIT Vellore. Right now, I&apos;m also working as an intern at Amazon in Banglore.</p>
    <br/><br/>
    <p className="hero--text">I love to code, especially web development. I really like learning new programming languages, comparing them with the languages I already know and seen how they work and why they were created in the first place. JavaScript, Python and Elixer are my favourite languages.</p>
    <p className="hero--text">Apart from geeking out about computers, I also love gaming and reading books. I play almost all kinds of games, expect FPS and RTS. When it comes to books, I mostly read fantsy novels but I try to read some non-fiction once in a while. I also like graphics design and UI design. I can spend hours browsing Dribbble and Tumblr. Unfortunately, grahics desing is hard and (as you can probably tell) I&apos;m not very good at it. And like any sane person, I love music.</p>
    <p className="hero--text">I made this website to serve as a blog. Though I haven&apos;t started writing any blog posts yet, I plan to write about things I learn about programing, the books I read and the games I play. That being said, I don&apos;t want to limit myself to only these topics. Also, I&apos;m still learning and I&apos;m not an expert in any of the above mentioned topics, so take everything you read here with a grain of salt.</p>
    <p className="hero--text">Finally, I don&apos;t know how you got here but I&apos;m glad you came. Thank you for visiting! Your feedback is always welcomed.</p>
