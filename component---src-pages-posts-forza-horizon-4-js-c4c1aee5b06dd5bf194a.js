Performance tuning is meaning full and a good tune can compensate for the inevitable mistakes you make during a race.

Apart from this, the most common items you get from wheel spins are clothes and accessories for your in-game avatar. When compared to other possible rewards which include cars and in-game credits, it is hard not to feel cheated when you get some random clothing item for an avatar which a majority of players will not see again. Another major criticism faced by FH4 is the engine noise and other sounds coming out of a car is the worst among all current generation racing games.
